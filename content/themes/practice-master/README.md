# Practice

![Practice Theme Demo](https://github.com/Dennis-Mayk/Practice/blob/master/preview.gif)
A clean timeline theme for the Ghost CMS.
This theme has been build from the ground up with a focus on only the most essential elements to keep the user experience smooth and fast.

##Installation
Just download an instance of <b>Practice</b> to your ghost's theme folder (you eventually will need to restart ghost).

##Build for Speed and User Experience
I have designed this theme with as little resources as possible to make it load faster but without compromising on user experience.

##Improvements
I will continue working on <b>Practice</b> to increase performance and keep it up to date with newer Ghost versions.
If you feel like you want to contribute feel free to drop me a message.
