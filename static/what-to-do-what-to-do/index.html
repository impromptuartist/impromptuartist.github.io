        <h4 id="imakethingsdifficultformyself">I make things difficult for myself.</h4>

<p>I'm a perfectionist. It's what I do. </p>

<p>This new venture is no different. What should I use for a blog theme? Should I get a pre-made theme? Should I make my own? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ah yes, the famous can-do attitude. Here comes the problem. If it's not perfect at first, it's not ever going to be good enough. We all know that's bullshit and yet here I am, stuck in the same cycle. </p>

<p>Enough.</p>

<h4 id="itsnotsomethingishoulddoitssomethingicando">It's not something I should do, it's something I can do.</h4>

<p>Mom's are good for many things, not the least of which is motivation. Something she told me rings very true in making this blog. Telling myself I <em>should</em> do something is very different than telling myself I <em>can</em> do something.</p>

<p>Should creates guilt. Can creates <strong>options</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="sowhatdoesthatmean">So what does that mean?</h4>

<p>It means that I'm going to keep this default theme for a little bit while I make my own... and that's okay. Let's try something new for a change. Good enough will work for now and better will come soon. It always does.</p>

<hr>

<p>Until next time. </p>
